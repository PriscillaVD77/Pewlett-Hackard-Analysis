## Summary: 
Our analysis has given Pwelette Hackard some information about the change coming to their company due to the "silver tsunami". We were able to organize the information to find which roles and how many people in each role will need to be filled. We also found information to help with the transition that will tell us who is eligible for the mentorship program.
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?<br>

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees  in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?<br>
The following chart shows which employees are elegibile to take on a mentorship role in a mentorship program.
![mentorship_eligibility](Resources/mentorship_eligibility.png)<br>
<br>
In total there will be 90,398 prospective roles that will need to be filled. According to our Mentorship Eligibility table there are 1,549 people to take on this role. There are enough employees to mentor but they would be in charge of large groups of trainees. There is not enough mentors for a one to one mentorship ratio.<br>
It may also be beneficial to create a query that can tell us about the salries of those employees that are eligible for retirement to understand an idea of the budget for rehiring. We can create a query as shown below: <br>
<br>
![retired_salary_query](Resources/retired_salary_query.png)<br>
<br>
We would then have the following table as output: <br>
<br>
![retired_salary](Resources/retired_salary.png)<br>
<br>
We can also create another query to find the total of their salaries as shown below: <br>
![sum_salary](Resources/sum_salary.png)<br>
<br>
They could use these tables and queires to help them better prepare for potential rehiring in the near future.
